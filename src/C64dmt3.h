/**
 * This file contains MIDI instrument defenitions for use with the OPL2 Audio Board library. These were converted from
 * the General MIDI timbres by The Fat Man(TM). This file contains the melodic instrments only.
 *
 * Instrument definition is based on Adlib instrument bank format.
 *  0 - Rhythm mode drum channel
 *		Drum channels are predefined by the YM3812 and cannot be redefined. Regular instruments have their channel set
 *		to 0x00 and can be assigned to any channel by the setInstrument function. Rhythm mode instruments can only be
 *		used when rhythm mode is active (see OPL2.setPercussion).
 *
 *  1 - Channel c, operator 1, register 0x20
 *		Tremolo(1) | Vibrato(1) | Sustain(1) | KSR(1) | Frequency multiplier (4)
 *
 *  2 - Channel c, operator 1, register 0x40
 *		Key scale level(2) | Output level(6)
 *
 *  3 - Channel c, operator 1, register 0x60
 *		Attack(4) | Decay(4)
